export const dorud=`A man's total sins will be washed away if he recites Durood-e-Fath for forty day

It is a divine order that good is rewarded with good. Thus one needs to
think that; besides Allah I whose unlimited favours are beyond
repayable; the being that has benefitted man the most is none other
than the messenger of Allah, Muhammad r.
In this day, when neither have we the ability to see, nor converse with
the prophet r, we have forgotten his favours upon us, nor can we
comprehend them. One must remember; that truth, if ignored or
forgotten, still remains the truth.
The prophet r was sinless, and had the guarantee of Allah’s I eternal
and infinite love, yet still, not for his own further advancement but for
our’s, did he spend night after night, day after day, begging Allah I for
our salvation. The physical torture hurled at him by the opposition for
propagating Islam, the psychological anguish suffered by him when
seeing his beloved followers persecuted and the mental torment
undertaken by him in his unending concern for his people; all bear
testimony to the debt that we owe to this selfless man.`

export const naat=`Naat — A Proven way of Spiritual Healing and Therapy

Spiritual Healing is not a new concept. It has been in practice for couple of decades and even science has proved its effectiveness. Naat is any poetry written to praise the greatness of Holy Prophet(P.B.U.H), the last Prophet in Islam. Through research, it has been observed that by listening Naats, our body creates special kind of chemicals which not only relieves stress but also cures many diseases.
Science says that there exists two types of effects named Placebo and Nocebo. Placebo effect simply means that whenever your mind is expecting or believing in something good, Good happens. and Nocebo effect is the opposite which means that when you are disappointed or aren’t expecting good, something bad happens. These effects have a very close connection with how body reacts to different events. This is, in no way, a proof of Naat healing spiritually but is a hypothesis to tell you that our body responds to the events happening around us very effectively.
In Muslim countries specially Pakistan, people have been listening Naats to relieve stress and they say that it works. Religion, as we all know is an integral part of our life. Stephen covey in his book “7 habits of highly effective people” states that religion is the fourth most important part of life which must be taken care of, to live a successful, happy and satisfied life. Even doctors(non-muslims too), all around the world, use “Surah e Rehman”, a section from Holy Quran(the book in Islam), to cure their patients admitted in their ICUs. They say that they have seen huge improvements in their patients after 1 week of regular listening.`
